# SQL-Unique-Problems

Here, I am solving different SQL problems with solutions for interview preparation. And the datasets are gathered from different sites and channels.
##
Problem 1:

You are given two tables: Restaurants and Orders. After receiving an order, 
each restaurant has 15 minutes to dispatch it. Dispatch times are categorized as follows:

on_time_dispatch: Dispatched within 15 minutes of order received.
late_dispatch: Dispatched between 15 and 20 minutes after order received.
super_late_dispatch: Dispatched after 20 minutes.
Task: Write an SQL query to count the number of dispatched orders in each category for each restaurant.

##
Problem 2:

write a query to find users whose transactions has breached their credit limit from the given dataset.
